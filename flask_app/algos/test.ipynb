Karimabadi2 1Space Science Center, Morse Hall, University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire, USA, 2SciberQuest, Inc., Del Mar, California, USA Abstract The reconnection current layer thickness is expected to scale with either the ion inertial length or the ion gyroradius. Both of these quantities scale with the mass of the ions present. During geomagnetically disturbed times, the reconnection layer in the magnetotail can contain a signiﬁcant amount of O+. Using Cluster multi-spacecraft measurements, we have studied nine reconnection events in the magnetotail plasmasheet, to determine whether the reconnecting current sheet thickness scales with the ion gyroradius or the ion inertial length, and whether the amount of O+ in the plasma sheet has an effect on the current layer thickness. We ﬁnd that the thickness is equal to the H+ gyroradius, even when the plasma sheet has a high O+ content. This result is in contrast to Hall MHD expectations and likely results from the multiscale nature of the current sheet. 1. Introduction One key question in magnetic reconnection is what determines the structure of the reconnection layer. Two- ﬂuid analysis shows that the ions and electrons can move independent of each other at the reconnection site and form a multilayer diffusion region: a smaller electron diffusion region embedded within a larger ion diffusion region [Sonnerup, 1979; Biskamp et al., 1997]. The scale of electron and ion diffusion regions and the thickness of their associated current layers are about the scale of the electron/ion inertial length or the gyroradius [Sonnerup, 1979]. In the generalized Ohm’s law, the ion inertial length is introduced via the Hall current, and the ion gyroradius scale is introduced via the ion off-diagonal pressure tensors [Sonnerup, 1979]. Wu et al. [2011], using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, determined that the width of the ion diffusion region scales with the upstream ion inertial length but that the ion local meandering radius also scales as the ion inertial length. Thus, they would expect the thickness to scale as the local gyroradius. Previous observations in the earth’s magnetopause and magnetotail have shown that the current sheet thickness is of the order of the ion inertial length in individual cases [Mozer et al., 2002; Runov et al., 2006; Phan et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2007]. However, these studies were only determining rough scales and did not distinguish between ion inertial length and ion gyroradius or compare the thickness quantitatively with the gyroradius. Thus, the question of how the reconnecting current sheet thickness relates to the ion inertial length or gyroradius has not been resolved by observation. During some substorms, especially during storm times, O+ can be abundant in the near-earth plasma sheet [Mouikis et al., 2010]. These heavier O+ ions can also be involved in the reconnection process. Kistler et al. [2005] used Cluster data to show that O+ ions can carry more than 10% of the reconnecting current. How these heavy ions affect the reconnecting current sheet thickness observationally has never been addressed. In this paper, we use Cluster data from time periods when Cluster crosses the region close to the X-line, to perform a statistical study. Two questions are addressed: how does the thickness of the reconnecting current sheet scale with the H+ and O+ inertial length and gyroradius, and how does the thickness depend on the O+ content. 2. Observation 2.1. Instrumentation The CLUSTER satellites crossed the near-earth reconnection X-line many times in the ﬁrst four tail seasons. The in situ ion data used in this study are from the Composition and Distribution Function (CODIF) sensor of the Cluster ion spectrometry (CIS) instrument [Rème et al., 2001] and the magnetometer instrument (Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM)) [Balogh et al., 2001] onboard Cluster. CODIF measures the three-dimensional distribution LIU ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 4819 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2014GL060440 functions of the major ion species over the energy per charge range 40–40,000 eV/e. Since we only focus on the diffusion region crossing time, when the bulk velocity is nearly 0, this energy range is expected to include the bulk of the density and pressure in our study. 2.2. Current Sheet Thickness Measurements The current sheet in the earth’s magnetotail can be simply modeled as a one-dimensional Harris Sheet: Bx ¼ B0 tanh (cid:3) (cid:1) z (cid:2) z0 h (1) , where Bx is the locally measured x component of the magnetic ﬁeld, B0 is the lobe ﬁeld magnitude, z is the spacecraft location, z0 is the location of the center of the current sheet, and h is the half thickness of the current sheet. The lobe magnetic ﬁeld, B0, is estimated from local plasma and magnetic ﬁeld measurements assuming pressure balance, B0 ¼ , where PT is the averaged total pressure measured by two spacecraft. Thus, there are two unknowns, z0 and h. Using data measured by two spacecraft, the thickness of the current sheet can be determined by ﬁtting to the 1-D Harris sheet. Since ion data are available from the CODIF instrument on Cluster SC 1, 3, and 4, we can perform up to three estimations of the half thickness of the current sheet if all three spacecraft have measurements during the given time interval. In this study, if one of the spacecraft is located within the lobe, the atanh function is unsolvable, and no thickness is determined. ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2μPT p Another way to estimate the current sheet thickness is using a time-varying Harris sheet ﬁt, as ﬁrst proposed by Lui [1993]. The time-varying Harris current sheet model ﬁtting assumes that: h tð Þ ¼ 0 tð Þ (cid:2) B2 B2 μ0B0Jy tð Þ x tð Þ ; (2) where all the terms are the same as equation (1) but Jy is calculated via the Cluster four spacecraft curlometer technique [Dunlop et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2005]. When the spacecraft separation is smaller than or comparable to the measured current sheet thickness, the curlometer technique is more accurate for estimating the current density and hence the time-varying current sheet thickness than the 2-spacecraft ﬁt. A third method is to use the magnetic ﬁeld gradient estimation, a method ﬁrst proposed by Shen et al. [2008]. With the Cluster curlometer technique, we are able to estimate the ∇B during the current sheet crossing. Thus, the half thickness of the current sheet can be expressed as h ¼ ∫h dB=j ∇Bj ≈ B0 (cid:2) Bmin dz ¼ ∫B0 Þ= ∇Bj i j h (3) Bmin ð 0 , where the Bmin is the minimum magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld during the crossing of current sheet. In this paper, we assume that Bmin ≪ B0 and get h = B0/h|∇B|i. This method does not assume a Harris sheet model. 2.3. Data 2.3.1. Event Study We ﬁrst present the data for one reconnection X-line crossing event. Using this event as an example, we show how the events for the statistical study are selected and how the following parameters are deduced: the reconnecting current sheet thickness h, the H+ and O+ gyroradii, ρHþ , ρOþ , the H+ and O+ inertial length dHþ , dOþ, and the current sheet O+ to H+ density ratio nOþ =nHþ. Then we will present the statistical results based on our nine event pool. Figures 1a–1c show the relative locations of the four Cluster spacecraft during the time interval 15 September 2001/05:02:00UT–15 September 2001/05:06:00UT. The spacecraft have an average separation of ~1000 km. This separation approaches the scale of the reconnecting current sheet thickness and makes the implementation of the curlometer technique possible. In Figure 2, we present data measured by the Cluster spacecraft during this interval. Cluster SC4 crosses the current sheet from the north lobe to the south as indicated by the change in Bx in Figure 2d. During the time interval marked by the blue shaded area (around 05:03:30 UT), Cluster SC 1, 3, and 4 observed the H+ fast ﬂow reversal from earthward to tailward (Figure 2c). Meanwhile, the correlated vx and Bz reversal (Figures 2c and 2d) and the corresponding Hall ﬁeld change (Figure 2e) were also observed. These observables have been reported by previous studies [Birn et al., 2001; Eastwood et al., 2010] and are regarded as the signatures of an X-line crossing. By comparing the theoretical prediction with observed data, the spacecraft LIU ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union.

Figure 1d shows the SC4 relative locations during its passage of the X-line. locations relative to the X-line are determined and illustrated in Figure 1d. In addition, we have checked the oxygen distribution functions during the time periods of interest. The purpose of this is twofold: (1) to conﬁrm that Cluster has crossed the X-line in the vicinity of the ion diffusion region; (2) to check whether O+ has mediated the reconnection process. After 05:03:40UT, SC 1, 3, and 4 entered the earthward outﬂow region. During the transient time interval 05:03:24UT–05:03:40UT, the fast vx and Bz reversals are observed. This conﬁrms that this X-line crossing is within the ion diffusion region. In Figure 3, we show the O+ 2D cuts of the 3D distribution functions measured by SC 1, 3, and 4 in GSM coordinates during the identiﬁed transient interval. The vx (cid:2) vy cuts (ﬁrst column) show that the O+ ions move in the + vy direction, at the locations of all three spacecraft. The vx (cid:2) vz cuts (second column) show that they exhibit counter-streaming beams along the vz axis. This bouncing motion, while streaming in y, can also be observed in vy (cid:2) vz cut, in the third column. The distribution measured by SC1 shows a shift in + vx in vx (cid:2) vy and vx (cid:2) vz cuts, compared with SC3 and SC4 measured distributions. Because SC1 is located earthward or downstream from SC3 and SC4 (Figure 1), the shift in + vx indicates that the O+ ions have gained an outﬂow velocity along vx. The distribution function pattern depicted in Figures 3a–3c demonstrates the classical meandering or Speiser-like orbit of O+ ions, which shows that O+ ions are demagnetized and exhibit the signature expected in an active reconnection site. Such a distribution pattern has been discussed by Hoshino et al. [1998] within the ion diffusion region and is different from the distribution in the initial Harris sheet. The distributions in the initial Harris sheet, both in simulations and in our observations, consist of meandering particles with a broad range of thermal velocities in the hot plasmas forming a Maxwellian. In Figure 3d, we show such an example of the Maxwellian-like O+ distribution function around central current sheet during geomagnetically quiet time. Using the distribution function as a diagnostic, we can conﬁrm that O+ is involved in the reconnection process and that the spacecraft crossed the O+ diffusion region. After performing the checks stated above, we collect the parameters to prepare for the statistical study.

Although the current sheet half thickness as estimated by the different methods varies, the estimations show the same trends in particular around the time of the fast ﬂow reversal. Although the thickness estimation by the gradient method deviates substantially from others in this event, it agrees well with other estimations in other events and excluding this method entirely does not substantially change our statistical result below. Using the identiﬁed diffusion region crossing time, shaded blue in Figure 2, we record the values of the local magnetic ﬁeld magnitude BT from all spacecraft, the lobe magnetic ﬁeld magnitude B0 (not shown), the H+ and O+ temperature TH + and TO + (Figure 2j), and the half current sheet thickness from all the estimation methods (Figure 2l). The second dotted vertical line marks the crossing of the center of the current sheet which is identiﬁed as the time when Bx is 0 nT by SC4. We use this time to get the ion density nH + and nO + at the center of the current sheet in order to calculate the nO +/nH + density ratio (Figure 2k) and the ion inertial length dH + and dOþ ds ¼ c= 4πnse2=m (cid:3) .

For consistency, we only use the ion composition and temperature measured by SC4 in our statistical study. However, for the local magnetic ﬁeld, we use the measurements for all spacecraft that are in the diffusion region. 2.3.1. Statistical Study For our statistical study we reﬁned the event pool of X-line crossings observed by Cluster as reported in Eastwood et al. [2010]. Eastwood et al. [2010] provided a list of 19 Cluster X-line crossings with one guide ﬁeld case and 18 antiparallel cases, mainly identiﬁed using the vx and Bz reversal criterion. Some of these crossings are very close to each other, so we ﬁrst combined crossings from similar times as representing one event to make each selected event unique. The crossings in 2002 are not used because the large spacecraft separation and O+ distribution (4000 km) cannot be used to implement the curlometer technique. In addition, both the e functions are checked to conﬁrm the crossing of the ion diffusion region and the O+ involvement in the reconnection process. After this ﬁltering we are left with nine events from 2001 and 2003. The spacecraft separation is 1000 km in 2001 and 300 km in 2003, and all these nine events show the signatures of the ion diffusion region crossing according to our criteria. For each of these events the statistical parameters are collected, as our previous example illustrated. In Table 1, we list the events and the in situ measured nO +/nH + density ratio. The value of nO +/nH + is widely distributed and can be used as a parameter to evaluate the O+ effect on current sheet thickness. (cid:2) Figure 4 shows the statistical results. Each data point represents one event. In Figures 4a and 4b, we show the reconnecting current sheet half thickness as a function of the H+ and O+ gyroradius calculated using the local magnetic ﬁeld BT. Each point represents the median value of at least ﬁve and at most seven estimations of the current sheet half thickness, using the 1-D Harris ﬁt (up to three estimates), the time-varying Harris sheet method (up to three measurements), and the gradient-B method (one estimate). The vertical error bar gives the range of estimated values. In a few events, the error bar is large due to the disagreements between the estimations from different methods. The horizontal error bars give the range of gyroradii determined using the magnetic ﬁeld of all spacecraft that are in the diffusion region during the crossing, but not exactly at the neutral sheet. The slopes of the best-ﬁt lines are h=ρHþ ¼ 0:91 and h=ρOþ ¼ 0:23, indicating that the LIU ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union.

The half current sheet thickness as the function of (a) H+ gyroradius and (b) O+ gyroradius estimated with the local magnetic ﬁeld, (c) H+ gyroradius and (d) O+ gyroradius estimated with the lobe magnetic ﬁeld, and (e) H+ inertial length and (f) O+ inertial length estimated with central current sheet plasma density. Each point represents the median value of multiple measurements and the error bar is the median absolute deviation. The ﬁlled circles indicate higher O+ to H+ density ratio, and open circles indicate lower O+ to H+ density ratio. The circle ﬁlled with red marks the 1 October 2001 event which has an extremely high O+ to H+ density ratio. current sheet half thickness is of the order of the H+ gyroradious. In addition, the events are separated into low O+ content events (open circles) and high O+ content events (ﬁlled circles). For this distinction the medium value, 0.082, of the nO +/nH + density ratios listed in Table 1 was used as the threshold. As illustrated, the high O+ points are randomly dispersed along the same line. The dependence of the current sheet thickness on the H+ gyroradius is the same, even when the nO +/nH + ratio is high. Figures 4c and 4d show the correlation between the half current sheet thickness and the ion gyroradius estimated using the lobe magnetic ﬁeld B0. Because the variation in the lobe ﬁeld determined for the three spacecraft is small, no horizontal error bar is included. There is a correlation of the current sheet thickness with the lobe H+ gyroradius, with a slope corresponding to 4.12 times the lobe H+ gyroradius. The correlation of the thickness with the H+ gyroradius is weak. Figures 4e and 4f show the correlation of the half current sheet thickness with the local ion inertial length for H+ and O+. No obvious correlation with the current sheet thickness is observed. Since it is not possible to estimate the lobe densities from the local plasma sheet measurements, no comparison can be made between the current sheet thickness and the lobe ion inertial length. 3. Discussion Our results indicate that the reconnecting current sheet half thickness is about the scale of H+ gyroradius, independent of the O+ abundance, rather than being a hybrid of the two values. However, we show that O+ does become involved in the reconnection process. The O+ distribution function pattern indicating that O+ ions perform a meandering motion across the tail is observed and is used as another signature to identify the ion diffusion region crossing. LIU ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 4825 Geophysical Research Letters 10.1002/2014GL060440 Some insight into this result comes from a comparison with the results of Artemyev et al. [2008]. Artemyev et al. [2008] used Cluster data to study the thickness of thin current sheets and found that the current sheet thickness is wider when there is more O+ content. This study did not focus speciﬁcally on reconnection events. In Artemyev et al. [2008], they used a non-Harris sheet model developed by Zelenyi et al. [2006] to ﬁt the current sheet. In this model, a ﬂattened tail in the current proﬁle contributed by O+ has been taken into account, and the ﬂattened tail of the current sheet does get widened by O+ and reaches the scale of the plasma sheet. In our study, we have used the Harris-type current sheet (static Harris sheet ﬁtting and time-varying Harris sheet ﬁtting), in which the scale of the dramatic change in the current density is deﬁned to be the current sheet thickness. Thus, it may be that the detailed current sheet proﬁle is affected by the O+, but the largest change in current sheet density is dominated by the H+ contribution. Thus, it is likely that it is the multiscale structure of the current sheet that leads to the difference between our results and Artemyev et al. [2008]. ð This multiscale structure is expected because the O+ ions have a larger gyroradius ρOþ ¼ 4ρHþ Þ, than the H+ ions at the same initial energy. Thus, O+ can be demagnetized earlier than H+ around the X-line, due to its larger gyroradius, which will result in a wider O+ diffusion region outside the H+ diffusion region. Our result shows that the wider O+ diffusion region does not signiﬁcantly affect the overall current sheet thickness, which is still dominated by the inner H+ contribution. In the X-line region, the ions perform a meandering motion, with the particles bouncing in the z direction and drifting in the y direction. Meanwhile, the particle gains energy from its motion along the electric ﬁeld Ey. However, the acceleration process cannot go inﬁnitely, because the particle will ﬁnally become magnetized and be guided by the Bz component to be ejected out in the x direction with fast speed [Speiser, 1967; Hoshino et al., 1998]. The net motion of ions in the dawn-dusk direction then carries the current. Because the H+ ions have a lower mass, they can be more easily accelerated in the y direction and reach a higher vy within the smaller H+ diffusion region, while O+ can only reach these velocities downstream of the H+ diffusion region but in the O+ diffusion region. This can be compared with the Shay and Swisdak [2004] results, where they found that the H+ reaches a higher outﬂow speed around the X-line while O+ reaches its maximum outﬂow speed further downstream, and with a lower value than the H+ maximum velocity. Therefore, H+ is still the main current carrier in the H+ diffusion region, while O+ only contributes a small fraction of the current. O+ may still dominate the current within the O+ diffusion region, further downstream. In addition, H+ is the dominant species in all of our events, except the 2001 October 1 event (table 1). The 2001 October 1 event (red ﬁlled circle in Figure 4) has an extremely high nO +/nH + ratio, but the estimated thickness is still about the scale of the H+ gyroradius, although the error bars are large. This might indicate that because the H+ contribution is more spatially concentrated, it can still control the current sheet thickness even when it is not the dominant ion species. Because the cross-tail velocity of the H+ ions are higher, the current is mainly carried by H+, and the dramatic change of current density still occurs on the H+ scale around the X point. Within the O+ diffusion region, the current carried by the demagnetized O+ is much smaller than the bulk current. In this study, we found that the reconnecting current sheet thickness scales with the ion gyroradius, not with the ion local inertial length. This is consistent with the ﬁnding by Wu et al. [2011]. As discussed in the introduction, Wu et al. [2011] found that the thickness of the current sheet scales with the upstream ion inertial length but that the meandering gyroradius in the current sheet thickness scales as the upstream ion inertial length, as well. Thus, they would expect that the thickness would scale as the local gyroradius. The result that the current sheet thickness does not vary with the plasma composition may explain the ﬁndings by Liu et al. [2013], who showed that a higher pre-onset O+ density in the plasma sheet can result in a faster unloading rate during the substorm expansion phase. The current sheet thickness has a strong controlling inﬂuence over the loading and unloading rates during substorms. As shown in Karimabadi et al. [2011], the growth rate is an increasing function of ρ/L. If L is determined by H+ only, independent of composition, then the high O+ case would approach ρ/L = 4 while the low O+ case has ρ/L = 1. This in turn leads to a faster tearing growth rate in the high O+ case which may result in faster unloading rates [Karimabadi et al., 2011] as was found in the Cluster observations by Liu et al. [2013]. LIU ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union.

       "'The current sheet in the earth’s magnetotail can be simply modeled as a one-dimensional Harris Sheet: Bx ¼ B0 tanh (cid:3) (cid:1) z (cid:2) z0 h (1) , where Bx is the locally measured x component of the magnetic ﬁeld, B0 is the lobe ﬁeld magnitude, z is the spacecraft location, z0 is the location of the center of the current sheet, and h is the half thickness of the current sheet.The half current sheet thickness as the function of (a) H+ gyroradius and (b) O+ gyroradius estimated with the local magnetic ﬁeld, (c) H+ gyroradius and (d) O+ gyroradius estimated with the lobe magnetic ﬁeld, and (e) H+ inertial length and (f) O+ inertial length estimated with central current sheet plasma density.In our study, we have used the Harris-type current sheet (static Harris sheet ﬁtting and time-varying Harris sheet ﬁtting), in which the scale of the dramatic change in the current density is deﬁned to be the current sheet thickness.Using Cluster multi-spacecraft measurements, we have studied nine reconnection events in the magnetotail plasmasheet, to determine whether the reconnecting current sheet thickness scales with the ion gyroradius or the ion inertial length, and whether the amount of O+ in the plasma sheet has an effect on the current layer thickness.When the spacecraft separation is smaller than or comparable to the measured current sheet thickness, the curlometer technique is more accurate for estimating the current density and hence the time-varying current sheet thickness than the 2-spacecraft ﬁt.[2011] found that the thickness of the current sheet scales with the upstream ion inertial length but that the meandering gyroradius in the current sheet thickness scales as the upstream ion inertial length, as well.Using this event as an example, we show how the events for the statistical study are selected and how the following parameters are deduced: the reconnecting current sheet thickness h, the H+ and O+ gyroradii, ρHþ , ρOþ , the H+ and O+ inertial length dHþ , dOþ, and the current sheet O+ to H+ density ratio nOþ =nHþ.By on SC 1, 3, and 4, (f) GSM Bz on SC 1, 3, and 4, (g) current density, (h) |∇B|, (i) percentage of |∇ (cid:3) B| over |∇B|, (j) H+ and O+ temperature, from SC4, (k) H+ to O+ density ratio from SC4, and (l) estimated half current sheet thickness by different methods.Using the identiﬁed diffusion region crossing time, shaded blue in Figure 2, we record the values of the local magnetic ﬁeld magnitude BT from all spacecraft, the lobe magnetic ﬁeld magnitude B0 (not shown), the H+ and O+ temperature TH + and TO + (Figure 2j), and the half current sheet thickness from all the estimation methods (Figure 2l).Figure 2l shows the half current sheet thickness calculated via all methods: the static Harris sheet ﬁtting for the three spacecraft pairs, the time- varying Harris sheet ﬁtting for each spacecraft, and the gradient B estimation methods.The time-varying Harris current sheet model ﬁtting assumes that: h tð Þ ¼ 0 tð Þ (cid:2) B2 B2 μ0B0Jy tð Þ x tð Þ ; (2) where all the terms are the same as equation (1) but Jy is calculated via the Cluster four spacecraft curlometer technique [Dunlop et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2005].Since it is not possible to estimate the lobe densities from the local plasma sheet measurements, no comparison can be made between the current sheet thickness and the lobe ion inertial length.Each point represents the median value of at least ﬁve and at most seven estimations of the current sheet half thickness, using the 1-D Harris ﬁt (up to three estimates), the time-varying Harris sheet method (up to three measurements), and the gradient-B method (one estimate).In this study, we found that the reconnecting current sheet thickness scales with the ion gyroradius, not with the ion local inertial length.Since ion data are available from the CODIF instrument on Cluster SC 1, 3, and 4, we can perform up to three estimations of the half thickness of the current sheet if all three spacecraft have measurements during the given time interval.[2008] used Cluster data to study the thickness of thin current sheets and found that the current sheet thickness is wider when there is more O+ content.In this model, a ﬂattened tail in the current proﬁle contributed by O+ has been taken into account, and the ﬂattened tail of the current sheet does get widened by O+ and reaches the scale of the plasma sheet.O+ 3D distribution function measured by Composition and Distribution Function (CODIF) onboard (a) SC 1, (b) SC3, (c) SC4 around the diffusion region crossing time, and (d) SC4 in the central current sheet during quiet time.Using data measured by two spacecraft, the thickness of the current sheet can be determined by ﬁtting to the 1-D Harris sheet.We use this time to get the ion density nH + and nO + at the center of the current sheet in order to calculate the nO +/nH + density ratio (Figure 2k) and the ion inertial length dH + and dOþ ds ¼ c= 4πnse2=m (cid:3) .Figures 4c and 4d show the correlation between the half current sheet thickness and the ion gyroradius estimated using the lobe magnetic ﬁeld B0.Two questions are addressed: how does the thickness of the reconnecting current sheet scale with the H+ and O+ inertial length and gyroradius, and how does the thickness depend on the O+ content.Thus, it may be that the detailed current sheet proﬁle is affected by the O+, but the largest change in current sheet density is dominated by the H+ contribution.Two- ﬂuid analysis shows that the ions and electrons can move independent of each other at the reconnection site and form a multilayer diffusion region: a smaller electron diffusion region embedded within a larger ion diffusion region [Sonnerup, 1979; Biskamp et al., 1997].[2011], using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, determined that the width of the ion diffusion region scales with the upstream ion inertial length but that the ion local meandering radius also scales as the ion inertial length.Kistler, L. M., et al. (2005), Contribution of nonadiabatic ions to the cross-tail current in an O + dominated thin current sheet, J. Geophys.The scale of electron and ion diffusion regions and the thickness of their associated current layers are about the scale of the electron/ion inertial length or the gyroradiusp Another way to estimate the current sheet thickness is using a time-varying Harris sheet ﬁt, as ﬁrst proposed by Lui [1993].Thompson, S. M., M. G. Kivelson, K. K. Khurana, R. L. McPherron, J. M. Weygand, A. Balogh, H. Reme, and L. M. Kistler (2005), Dynamic Harris current sheet thickness from Cluster current density and plasma measurements, J. Geophys.Thus, the question of how the reconnecting current sheet thickness relates to the ion inertial length or gyroradius has not been resolved by observation.In Figures 4a and 4b, we show the reconnecting current sheet half thickness as a function of the H+ and O+ gyroradius calculated using the local magnetic ﬁeld BT.The reconnection current layer thickness is expected to scale with either the ion inertial length or the ion gyroradius.Figures 4e and 4f show the correlation of the half current sheet thickness with the local ion inertial length for H+ and O+.Previous observations in the earth’s magnetopause and magnetotail have shown that the current sheet thickness is of the order of the ion inertial length in individual casesThe average ion gyroradius ρHþ and ρOþ ρs ¼ 2T sms can be estimated based on the measured local magnetic ﬁeld magnitude BT or asymptotic lobe ﬁeld B0 and the temperature T Hþ and T Oþ around the X-line crossing time (BT, B0, T Hþ , and T Oþ are recorded at the ﬁrst dashed line Figure 2).Current sheet thickness scales with H+ gyroradius (cid:129) O+ has no effect on the thickness Correspondence to: Y. H. Liu, yhliu@atlas.sr.unh.edu Citation:The ﬁrst vertical line marks the SC4 measured correlated vx and Bz reversal time, and the second vertical line marks when SC4 crossed the central current sheet (Bx = 0).The result that the current sheet thickness does not vary with the plasma composition may explain the ﬁndings by Liu et al.There is a correlation of the current sheet thickness with the lobe H+ gyroradius, with a slope corresponding to 4.12 times the lobe H+ gyroradius.Our result shows that the wider O+ diffusion region does not signiﬁcantly affect the overall current sheet thickness, which is still dominated by the inner H+ contribution.In the generalized Ohm’s law, the ion inertial length is introduced via the Hall current, and the ion gyroradius scale is introduced via the ion off-diagonal pressure tensors [Sonnerup, 1979].Discussion Our results indicate that the reconnecting current sheet half thickness is about the scale of H+ gyroradius, independent of the O+ abundance, rather than being a hybrid of the two values.Although the current sheet half thickness as estimated by the different methods varies, the estimations show the same trends in particular around the time of the fast ﬂow reversal.[Mozer et al., 2002; Runov et al., 2006; Phan et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2007].This might indicate that because the H+ contribution is more spatially concentrated, it can still control the current sheet thickness even when it is not the dominant ion species.Thus, the half thickness of the current sheet can be expressed as h ¼ ∫h dB=j ∇Bj ≈ B0 (cid:2) Bmin dz ¼ ∫B0 Þ= ∇Bji j h (3) Bmin ð 0 , where the Bmin is the minimum magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld during the crossing of current sheet.This separation approaches the scale of the reconnecting current sheet thickness and makes the implementation of the curlometer technique possible.The dependence of the current sheet thickness on the H+ gyroradius is the same, even when the nO +/nH + ratio is high.The Identiﬁed Reconnection Diffusion Region Crossings in 2001 and 2003 and the In Situ Measured nOþ =nHþ Density n(O+)/n(H+) Event Date Start End 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2001/08/22 2001/09/10 2001/09/12 2001/09/15 2001/10/01 2001/10/08 2003/09/19 2003/10/04 2003/10/09 09:40:00 07:55:00 13:10:00 05:00:00 09:44:00 12:50:00 23:28:00 06:18:00 02:20:00 09:45:00 08:00:00 13:15:00 05:05:00 09:51:00 13:00:00 23:33:00 06:23:00 02:30:00 0.021 0.016 0.767 0.336 3.556 0.281 0.081 0.061 0.082 smoothed using a box car algorithm for 30 s.Because the cross-tail velocity of the H+ ions are higher, the current is mainly carried by H+, and the dramatic change of current density still occurs on the H+ scale around the X point.The second dotted vertical line marks the crossing of the center of the current sheet which is identiﬁed as the time when Bx is 0 nT by SC4.How these heavy ions affect the reconnecting current sheet thickness observationally has never been addressed.Rev. Lett., 93(17), Shen, C., et al. (2008), Flattened current sheet and its evolution in substorms, J. Geophys.The horizontal error bars give the range of gyroradii determined using the magnetic ﬁeld of all spacecraft that are in the diffusion region during the crossing, but not exactly at the neutral sheet.However, these studies were only determining rough scales and did not distinguish between ion inertial length and ion gyroradius or compare the thickness quantitatively with the gyroradius.Within the O+ diffusion region, the current carried by the demagnetized O+ is much smaller than the bulk current.current sheet half thickness is of the order of the H+ gyroradious.At this time, the y component of the current density js (Figure 2g) is the dominant component, and |∇ (cid:3) B|/|∇B| LIU ET AL.Therefore, H+ is still the main current carrier in the H+ diffusion region, while O+ only contributes a small fraction of the current.No obvious correlation with the current sheet thickness is observed.The current sheet thickness has a strong controlling inﬂuence over the loading and unloading rates during substorms.The value of nO +/nH + is widely distributed and can be used as a parameter to evaluate the O+ effect on current sheet thickness.Because the H+ ions have a lower mass, they can be more easily accelerated in the y direction and reach a higher vy within the smaller H+ diffusion region, while O+ can only reach these velocities downstream of the H+ diffusion region but in the O+ diffusion region.Current Sheet Thickness MeasurementsIn Figure 3d, we show such an example of the Maxwellian-like O+ distribution function around central current sheet during geomagnetically quiet time.Hence, the jy and |∇B| are both used to calculate the current sheet thickness.Liu, Y. H., L. M. Kistler, C. G. Mouikis, V. Roytershteyn, and H. Karimabadi (2014), The scale of the magnetotail reconnecting current sheet in the presence of O+, Geophys.Thus, it is likely that it is the multiscale structure of the current sheet that leads to the difference between our results and Artemyev et(a) The SC4 measured H+ differential ﬂux versus energy and time, (b) O+ differential ﬂux versus energy and time, (c) x component of H+ velocity, on SC 1, 3, and 4, (d) GSM Bx on SC 1, 3, and 4, (e) GSMThe scale of the magnetotail reconnecting current sheet in the presence of O+ Y.

V., A. A. Petrukovich, L. M. Zelenyi, H. V. Malova, V. Y. Popov, R. Nakamura, A. Runov, and S. Apatenkov (2008), Comparison of multi-point measurements of current sheet structure and analytical models, Ann.Runov, A., R. Nakamura, and W. Baumjohann (2006), Multi-point study of the magnetotail current sheet, Adv.With the Cluster curlometer technique, we are able to estimate the ∇B during the current sheet crossing.Lui, A. T. Y. (1993), Inferring global characteristics of current sheet from local measurements, J. Geophys.The lobe magnetic ﬁeld, B0, is estimated from local plasma and magnetic ﬁeld measurements assuming pressure balance, B0 ¼ , where PT is the averaged total pressure measured by two spacecraft.Cluster SC4 crosses the current sheet from the north lobe to the south as indicated by the change in Bx in Figure 2d.This in turn leads to a faster tearing growth rate in the high O+ case which may result in faster unloading rates [Karimabadi et al., 2011] as was found in the Cluster observations by Liu et al.Rème, H., et al. (2001), First multispacecraft ion measurements in and near the Earth’s magnetosphere with the identical Cluster ion spec- trometry (CIS) experiment, Ann.This result is in contrast to Hall MHD expectations and likely results from the multiscale nature of the current sheet.The O+ distribution function pattern indicating that O+ ions perform a meandering motion across the tail is observed and is used as another signature to identify the ion diffusion region crossing.We ﬁnd that the thickness is equal to the H+ gyroradius, even when the plasma sheet has a high O+ content.Eastwood, J. P., T. D. Phan, M. Oieroset, and M. A. Shay (2010), Average properties of the magnetic reconnection ion diffusion region in the Earth’s magnetotail: The 2001- 2005 Cluster observations and comparison with simulations, J. Geophys.Thus, O+ can be demagnetized earlier than H+ around the X-line, due to its larger gyroradius, which will result in a wider O+ diffusion region outside the H+ diffusion region.The spacecraft separation is 1000 km in 2001 and 300 km in 2003, and all these nine events show the signatures of the ion diffusion region crossing according to our criteria.Wu, P., M. A. Shay, T. D. Phan, M. Oieroset, and M. Oka (2011), Effect of inﬂow density on ion diffusion region of magnetic reconnection: Particle-in-cell simulations, Phys.Zelenyi, L. M., H. V. Malova, V. Y. Popov, D. C. Delcourt, N. Y. Ganushkina, and A. S. Sharma (2006), \"Matreshka’’ model of multilayered current sheet, Geophys.e. Since we only focus on the diffusion region crossing time, when the bulk velocity is nearly 0, this energy range is expected to include the bulk of the density and pressure in our study.[2006] to ﬁt the current sheet.Phan, T. D., J. F. Drake, M. A. Shay, F. S. Mozer, and J. P. Eastwood (2007), Evidence for an elongated (>60 ion skin depths) electron diffusion region during fast magnetic reconnection, Phys. Rev. Lett., 99(25), doi:10.1103/Physrevlett.99.255002.In addition, both the e functions are checked to conﬁrm the crossing of the ion diffusion region and the O+ involvement in the reconnection process.However, for the local magnetic ﬁeld, we use the measurements for all spacecraft that are in the diffusion region.O+ may still dominate the current within the O+ diffusion region, further downstream.A third method is to use the magnetic ﬁeld gradient estimation, a method ﬁrst proposed by Shen et al.[2013], who showed that a higher pre-onset O+ density in the plasma sheet can result in a faster unloading rate during the substorm expansion phase.Using the distribution function as a diagnostic, we can conﬁrm that O+ is involved in the reconnection process and that the spacecraft crossed the O+ diffusion region.This conﬁrms that this X-line crossing is within the ion diffusion region.The in situ ion data used in this study are from the Composition and Distribution Function (CODIF) sensor of the Cluster ion spectrometry (CIS) instrumentBalogh, A., et al.
